     Kheer is a popular Indian dessert that is essentially a type of rice pudding. It's made by simmering rice (usually basmati), milk, and sugar together until the mixture thickens and the rice becomes soft and creamy. Often flavored with cardamom, saffron, and sometimes garnished with nuts like almonds, cashews, or pistachios, kheer is a versatile dish enjoyed across India and neighboring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. It can be served warm or chilled, and variations may include additions like raisins, rose water, or even grated coconut depending on regional preferences. Kheer is commonly prepared during festivals, celebrations, and religious occasions, embodying a rich culinary tradition that spans centuries in South Asia.
