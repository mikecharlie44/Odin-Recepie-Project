     Kheer is a popular Indian dessert that is essentially a type of rice pudding. It's made by simmering rice (usually basmati), milk, and sugar together until the mixture thickens and the rice becomes soft and creamy. Often flavored with cardamom, saffron, and sometimes garnished with nuts like almonds, cashews, or pistachios, kheer is a versatile dish enjoyed across India and neighboring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. It can be served warm or chilled, and variations may include additions like raisins, rose water, or even grated coconut depending on regional preferences. Kheer is commonly prepared during festivals, celebrations, and religious occasions, embodying a rich culinary tradition that spans centuries in South Asia.

            <h2> Step to make kheer </h2>
                <ol>
                
                    <li>  Wash and Soak Rice: <br>
                       Wash the rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 15-20 minutes.<br>
                     <br>
                 
                    </li>
                     
                        <br>
   
                    <li>Cook Rice:<br>

                        Drain the soaked rice and add it to a heavy-bottomed pan with milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat, <br>
                        then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the rice is fully cooked and the milk reduces and thickens. <br>
                         Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and burning.
   
                       <br>

                    
                       <br>
               
                    <li> Add Sugar and Flavorings: <br>
   
                         Once the rice is cooked and the milk has reduced to a creamy consistency, add sugar, cardamom powder, <br>
                         and saffron (if using). Stir well until the sugar dissolves completely.

                        <br>
                
                    <li>  Roast Nuts: <br>

                         Add the roasted nuts (and raisins) to the kheer and simmer for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the kheer thickens further to your desired consistency.

                      <br>
