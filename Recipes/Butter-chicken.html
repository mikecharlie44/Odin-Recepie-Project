     <p> Butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular North Indian dish renowned for its rich, creamy texture and flavorful taste. Originating from Delhi, India, it consists of tender chicken pieces marinated in yogurt and a blend of spices such as garam masala, ginger, garlic, and chili powder. The chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) for an authentic smoky flavor, although modern adaptations use a regular oven or grill. The sauce, or makhani gravy, is made with butter, tomatoes, cream, and various spices like fenugreek (kasuri methi) for a distinctive taste. Butter chicken is often enjoyed with naan bread or rice, making it a favorite in Indian restaurants worldwide for its creamy, mildly spicy, and comforting flavors.</p>
