Pizza is an iconic Italian dish that has gained immense popularity worldwide. It typically consists of a round, flattened dough base topped with tomato sauce, <br>
 cheese (usually mozzarella), and various toppings such as meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is traditionally made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and olive oil, <br> 
 and it is often baked in a wood-fired oven to achieve a crispy crust and smoky flavor. The origins of pizza can be traced back to Naples, Italy, where the <br>
 famous Neapolitan pizza is known for its thin and soft crust. In addition to the classic Margherita pizza (topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil), <br>
there are countless variations that reflect regional and international influences. For example, American-style pizza tends to have a thicker crust and a wider array of topping choices, <br>
 including pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, and more.Pizza has evolved into a global phenomenon, with adaptations and variations in nearly every country. It's enjoyed as a quick meal, <br>
a casual dining option, and even a gourmet delicacy depending on the ingredients and preparation style. Its universal appeal lies in its delicious combination of flavors, versatility, and ability to cater to diverse tastes and preferences. <br>

                        Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy. <br>
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. <br>
